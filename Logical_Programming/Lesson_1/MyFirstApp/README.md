# ISTEA Lesson 1

We wrote a super simple app that asks for user input and returns the sum of two integers (we didn't add any logic concerning user input data types and what not, we'll focus on that later).

- App execution example:

```console
‚ùØ dotnet run
Enter a number:
3
Enter another number:
4
The sum of these two numbers is: 7
```
