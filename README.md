What I'm learning right now:

- C# Basics
  - console scripts
- .NET / .NET Core Basics
  - dotnet SDK, CLI
    - I'm actually learning this on my own because I use MacOS and the school teaches on Windows so they just use Visual Studio magic for everything, I'm more of a terminal guy.
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Math
  - Python math scripts/utils and a little data analysis using Jupyter notebooks
- Microsoft SQL Server
  - I will also use MySQL and / or PostgreSQL at some point because I think MS SQL setup complexity is annoying. (Unless I get a Windows PC)

**_Beware_**: Some stuff will be written in spanish because I live in Argentina and I take lessons in spanish, so watch out for Spanglish!
